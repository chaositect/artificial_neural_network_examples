# artificial_neural_network_examples
A collection of Artificial Neural Networks to use as templates or case studies.

In my time studying ANN's I have worked along with examples, built my own test cases and constructed ready to use templates for quickstarting an ANN project.
This is just a small collection of ANN structures that I have put together over the years and have chosen to share for educational purposes.

When applicable, the name of the course from which the example was drawn is included in the file.

Each file is a stand alone script that can be run independently of all others.

(Some modifications may be required to work with a particular data set.)

Should you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me: grant@chaositect.com

Enjoy!
